This tool is meant for optimizing meshes in some commonly needed ways, with a focus on edges.

Feature 1 - Unnecessary edge deletion. The tool can delete edges which do not add noticeable complexity to a model, such as leftover edge loops from construction or boolean operations. The detection algorithm can be dialed up to delete edges more aggressively if additional optimization is needed. The tool supports ignoring edges along UV borders to avoid visual artifacts.

Feature 2 - This function smooths "hard" edges which inflate vertex counts through duplication of vertices via unshared tangents/binormals. This frequently occurs when assets are exported/re-imported using wrong settings or via formats like OBJ which don't support normals. This is a somewhat common issue in situations where content moves frequently between programs and gets converted to different file types, such as between Maya and ZBrush.

Before - When debugging tangent directions, you may notice that some of the blue vectors point multiple directions per vertex. This results in duplicated vertices and inflated asset costs. 

Vertices: 1596

Normals: 5706

After - There should only be as many tangents as there are normals, roughly. The model is fixed. 

Vertices: 1596

Normals: 1608 (~3.5x reduction from before)

The tool also supports a custom triangulation pass using a "greedy" edge connection algorithm, which produces geometry that I believe is ideal for decimation and volume preservation.
